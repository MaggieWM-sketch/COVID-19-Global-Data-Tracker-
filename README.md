# COVID-19-Global-Data-Tracker-
Short Description:
This project involves building a data analysis and reporting notebook (or app) that tracks global COVID-19 trends. Using real-world datasets, it analyzes cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across different countries and time periods. The project integrates **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization using Python-based tools to provide key insights and trends.  

Objectives:

✔️ Import and clean COVID-19 global data  
✔️Analyze time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations)  
✔️ Compare metrics across countries/regions  
✔️ Visualize trends using charts and maps  
✔️ Communicate findings effectively in a Jupyter Notebook or a PDF report  

Tools & Libraries Used:

✅ pandas – for data manipulation  
✅ matplotlib & seaborn – for visualization   
✅ Jupyter Notebook – for organizing analysis and reporting  

Insights & Reflections:  

📌 Countries had different pandemic curves, with some showing rapid case spikes while others had steady growth.  
📌 Vaccine rollout rates varied significantly across regions, affecting recovery trends.  
📌Data anomalies highlight potential inconsistencies in reporting between countries, revealing gaps in pandemic data.  
📌 Interactive maps and graphs help simplify complex trends, making global COVID-19 insights more accessible.
